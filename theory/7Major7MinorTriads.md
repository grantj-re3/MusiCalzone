# How to memorise 7 major & 7 minor chords

Which chords are we trying to memorise below?

- major triads: C, D, E, F, G, A, B
- minor triads: Cm, Dm, Em, Fm, Gm, Am, Bm

There are a few ways to remember the major and minor chords:

1. understand and memorise your scales, then extract the root, (major or minor)
   third and perfect fifth notes
1. count semi-tones from the root to the (major or minor) third and perfect fifth
   ([this](assets/musicIntervalTable.pdf) table may help)
1. memorise the chords (a [piano chord chart](../piano/Links_PianoChordCharts.md) or
   the first 2 minutes of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBvcyYXt4o) may help)
1. some fudge similar to the one we are about to discuss

After using all the chords for months or years, I imagine you will have memorised
many of them, or at least those which you play regularly. Until then, this page may
help you memorise the 7 major and 7 minor triads. It builds on some basic theory,
and I discuss this in the assumption sections below.


## 1. Assumes you know the 7 diatonic triads for the C major scale

By definition, the diatonic triads for the C major scale are comprised of *white piano-keys only*.

Roman numeral triad format                | I           | ii          | iii         | IV          | V           | vi          | vii°
------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------
Triad type                                | Major       | minor       | minor       | Major       | Major       | minor       | dim
Triad name                                | C           | Dm          | Em          | F           | G           | Am          | B°
Notes making the above triad/chord        | C-E-G       | D-F-A       | E-G-B       | F-A-C       | G-B-D       | A-C-E       | B-D-F

where ° is the diminished symbol


## 2. Assumes you know how to convert one triad to another

Triads in root position (i.e. not inverted) are a pattern of 3 notes consisting of:

- a root note
- an interval of a 3rd from the root
- an interval of a 5th from the root

The table below shows which 3rd and which 5th is used for the major, minor and diminished triads.

Triad      | Root | Which 3rd?                                 | Which 5th?
-----------|------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
Major      | Root | Major 3rd                                  | Perfect 5th
Minor      | Root | minor 3rd (half step lower than Major 3rd) | Perfect 5th
Diminished | Root | minor 3rd (half step lower than Major 3rd) | diminished 5th (half step lower than Perfect 5th)

In other words:

- if you know the major triad, you can find the minor triad by lowering the 3rd by a half step
- similarly if you know the minor triad, you can find the major triad by raising the 3rd by a half step
- if you know the diminished triad, you can find the minor triad by raising the 5th by a half step
- if you know the diminished triad, you can find the major triad by raising both the 3rd and 5th by a half step


## 3. Hence the 7 major & 7 minor triads can be found

Roman numeral triad format                | I           | ii          | iii         | IV          | V           | vi          | vii°
------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------
Triad type                                | Major       | minor       | minor       | Major       | Major       | minor       | dim
Triad name                                | C           | Dm          | Em          | F           | G           | Am          | B°
Notes making the above triad/chord        | C-E-G       | D-F-A       | E-G-B       | F-A-C       | G-B-D       | A-C-E       | B-D-F
***Major***                               |             |             |             |             |             |             |
Raise 3rd to convert minor/dim to major   |             | F→F#        | G→G#        |             |             | C→C#        | D→D#
Raise 5th to convert dim to major         |             |             |             |             |             |             | F→F#
Hence major triads: C,D,E,F,G,A,B         | C-E-G       | D-F#-A      | E-G#-B      | F-A-C       | G-B-D       | A-C#-E      | B-D#-F#
***Minor***                               |             |             |             |             |             |             |
Lower 3rd to convert major to minor       | E→Eb        |             |             | A→Ab        | B→Bb        |             |
Raise 5th to convert dim to minor         |             |             |             |             |             |             | F→F#
Hence minor triads: Cm,Dm,Em,Fm,Gm,Am,Bm  | C-Eb-G      | D-F-A       | E-G-B       | F-Ab-C      | G-Bb-D      | A-C-E       | B-D-F#

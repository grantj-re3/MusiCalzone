# How to memorise 7 major & 7 minor chords

Which chords are we trying to memorise below?

- major triads: C, D, E, F, G, A, B
- minor triads: Cm, Dm, Em, Fm, Gm, Am, Bm

After using all the chords for months or years, I imagine you will have memorised
many of them, or at least those which you play regularly. Until then, this page may
help you memorise the above 7 major and 7 minor triads. It builds on some basic
music theory, and I discuss this in the assumption sections below.


## 1. Assumes you know the 7 diatonic triads of the C major scale

By definition, the diatonic triads of the C major scale are comprised of *white piano-keys only*.

Roman numeral triad format                | I           | ii          | iii         | IV          | V           | vi          | vii°
------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------
Triad type                                | Major       | minor       | minor       | Major       | Major       | minor       | dim
Triad name                                | C           | Dm          | Em          | F           | G           | Am          | B°
Notes making the above triad/chord        | C-E-G       | D-F-A       | E-G-B       | F-A-C       | G-B-D       | A-C-E       | B-D-F

where ° is the diminished symbol


## 2. Assumes you know how to convert one triad to another

Triads in root position (i.e. not inverted) are a pattern of 3 notes consisting of:

- a root note
- an interval of a 3rd from the root
- an interval of a 5th from the root

The table below shows which 3rd and which 5th is used for the major, minor and diminished triads.

Triad      | Root | Which 3rd?                                 | Which 5th?
-----------|------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
Major      | Root | Major 3rd                                  | Perfect 5th
Minor      | Root | minor 3rd (half step lower than Major 3rd) | Perfect 5th
Diminished | Root | minor 3rd (half step lower than Major 3rd) | diminished 5th (half step lower than Perfect 5th)

In other words:

- if you know the major triad, you can find the minor triad by lowering the 3rd by a half step
- similarly if you know the minor triad, you can find the major triad by raising the 3rd by a half step
- if you know the diminished triad, you can find the minor triad by raising the 5th by a half step
- if you know the diminished triad, you can find the major triad by raising both the 3rd and 5th by a half step


## 3. Hence the 7 major & 7 minor triads can be found

Roman numeral triad format                | I           | ii          | iii         | IV          | V           | vi          | vii°
------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------
Triad type                                | Major       | minor       | minor       | Major       | Major       | minor       | dim
Triad name                                | C           | Dm          | Em          | F           | G           | Am          | B°
Notes making the above triad/chord        | C-E-G       | D-F-A       | E-G-B       | F-A-C       | G-B-D       | A-C-E       | B-D-F
***Major***                               |             |             |             |             |             |             |
Raise 3rd to convert minor/dim to major   |             | F→F#        | G→G#        |             |             | C→C#        | D→D#
Raise 5th to convert dim to major         |             |             |             |             |             |             | F→F#
Hence major triads: C,D,E,F,G,A,B         | C-E-G       | D-F#-A      | E-G#-B      | F-A-C       | G-B-D       | A-C#-E      | B-D#-F#
***Minor***                               |             |             |             |             |             |             |
Lower 3rd to convert major to minor       | E→Eb        |             |             | A→Ab        | B→Bb        |             |
Raise 5th to convert dim to minor         |             |             |             |             |             |             | F→F#
Hence minor triads: Cm,Dm,Em,Fm,Gm,Am,Bm  | C-Eb-G      | D-F-A       | E-G-B       | F-Ab-C      | G-Bb-D      | A-C-E       | B-D-F#


## 4. What about the remaining 5 major & 5 minor triads?

There are a few ways to remember the 12 major and 12 minor chords. They include:

1. understand and memorise your scales, then extract the root, (major or minor)
   third and perfect fifth notes
1. count half steps (i.e. semitones) from the root to the (major or minor) third
   and perfect fifth ([this](assets/musicIntervalTable.pdf) table may help)
1. memorise the chords (a [piano chord chart](../piano/Links_PianoChordCharts.md) or
   the first 2 minutes of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBvcyYXt4o) may help)
1. some fudge similar to the one discussed above

Note that if you repeat sections 1, 2 and 3 above using the 7 diatonic triads of the
*Db major* scale, you can construct the chords:

- major triads: Db, Eb, (F), Gb, Ab, Bb, (C)
- minor triads: Dbm, Ebm, (Fm), Gbm, Abm, Bbm, (Cm)

and so calculate details about the remaining 5 major and 5 minor chords where the root notes
are the *black piano-keys*.

(Note that F, Fm, C, Cm were already constructed in the above sections and so are not needed.
Hence I have shown these chords in brackets.)

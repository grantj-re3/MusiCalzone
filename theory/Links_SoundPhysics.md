## String vibration

   - The pitch of a note is determined by how rapidly the string vibrates. This depends on four things:
     1. Thicker, more massive strings vibrate more slowly.
     1. The frequency increases with the tension in the string.
     1. The length of the string that is free to vibrate is also important.
     1. You can also change the pitch by changing the mode of vibration [harmonics]
   - From the equations:
     * v  = fλ
     * f₁ = v/2L  (or λ₁ = 2L)
     * v  = √(F/μ)  where μ  = M/L
     * Note that variable *v* is the speed of the wave along the string (not the speed of sound).
   - We can derive the equations:
     * fₙ = (n/2L)√(F/μ) = (n/2L)√(FL/M) = (n/2)√(F/LM)
     * Hence, f₁ = ½√(F/LM)
     * Hence, F  = 4f₁²LM

# The physics of sound and music

1. [Science Sauce: Alex Nixon | Sound: Wavelength, Frequency and Amplitude (video) | 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsQL-sXZOLc)
   - A short introduction

1. [Pressbooks: David Abbott | Understanding Sound](https://pressbooks.pub/sound/)
   - In my view this is an excellent book. It consists of 48 web pages / chapers and has a very wide coverage. Some of the web pages can be read in 5-10 minutes although others may take longer to understand if you are unfamiliar with the concepts. I feel you don't need to read every page... you may be able to skip to the page of interest.
   - This book is free. It is open copyright (CC-BY).
   - An introduction to the physics of sound originally developed for students at Buffalo State College
   - This book is written for high school and college students who do not have much background in science or math. The book deliberately avoids incorporating basic physics topics (like force, energy and pressure) beyond what is absolutely needed for the book. The math is mostly at the 8th grade level- algebra, graph reading, ratio and proportion. There’s no calculus. There’s no trigonometry. The hardest math (logs and roots) is in the sections on decibels and musical intervals. (These sections can be skipped without disrupting the flow of the book).
   - A musical background is not required to understand this book, but it helps. Musicians have valuable experiences- producing sound, listening carefully to sound and (perhaps) reading music. I’ve brought in musical topics in the main text to help those with a musical background understand the material better.

## String vibration

1. [StudySmarter | Vibrating String](https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/physics/waves-physics/vibrating-string/)
   - A vibrating string in physics refers to a string's back-and-forth motion caused by an initial displacement from its equilibrium position, where it seeks to return but overshoots due to accumulated momentum.
   - The causes of string vibration involve an energy transfer and wave motion initiated by displacing a string from its equilibrium position. The string vibrates until all the initial provided energy is dissipated, and its frequency depends on its tension, length, and mass.
   - When a string vibrates, it creates a transverse wave with the string's displacement being perpendicular to the wave's motion. The speed of the wave depends on the tension and linear density of the string. This displacement and subsequent reflection of waves create standing wave patterns known as modes of vibrations.
   - The mathematical interpretation of vibrating strings... is characterized by standing waves that represent the harmonic frequencies of the string, known as the modes of vibration or harmonics.
   - Vibrating strings have numerous real-world applications, including producing sound in stringed instruments...

1. [University NSW: School of Physics: Joe Wolfe | Music Acoustics: Strings, standing waves and harmonics](https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/strings.html)
   - The pitch of a note is determined by how rapidly the string vibrates. This depends on four things:
     1. Thicker, more massive strings vibrate more slowly.
     1. The frequency increases with the tension in the string.
     1. The length of the string that is free to vibrate is also important.
     1. You can also change the pitch by changing the mode of vibration [harmonics]
   - From the equations:
     * f  = v/λ
     * λ₁ = 2L (hence f₁ = v/2L)
     * v  = √(F/μ)  where μ  = M/L and F is the tension force applied to the string
     * Note that variable *v* is the speed of the wave along the string (not the speed of sound).
   - We can derive the equations:
     * fₙ = (n/2L)√(F/μ) = (n/2L)√(FL/M) = (n/2)√(F/LM)
     * Hence, f₁ = ½√(F/LM)
     * Hence, F  = 4f₁²LM

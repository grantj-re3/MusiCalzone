## Scientific Pitch Notation (SPN)

Also known as:
- American Standard Pitch Notation (ASPN)
- International Pitch Notation (IPN)

This is a notation standard which gives names to notes such as C4 (middle C) or A0 (the lowest note on the piano).
Not to be confused with *Scientific Pitch* or *Standard Pitch* or *American Standard Pitch* or *ISO 16:1975* which are tuning-frequency standards.

*There does not appear to be a International Organization for Standardization (ISO), US or other formal standard for this notation.*

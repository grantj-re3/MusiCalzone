## Legato tonguing

A common way to describe how to play legato on the flute is to only use the tongue to start the first note and slur the remaining notes in the series, for example see:
[Kansas City Symphony: Kayla Burggraf | MUSIC TALK - Flute Legato (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=B_lFQauZGag). (Although Kayla may not be
using her tongue, you can see movement in her throat at the beginning of each note in the scale.) Below are some alternative descriptions where the tongue *is* used.

   - Legato articulation is successfully achieved with the tongue hitting the alveolar ridge, where the gums meet the teeth, with the tip of the tongue. This placement of the tongue is safe for all beginner flutists because the tip of the tongue does not come close to the aperture to disturb the air.

## Articulation

1. [Band Directors Talk Shop: Dr. Shauna Thompson | Mastering the Art of Flute Articulation | 2018](https://banddirectorstalkshop.com/mastering-the-art-of-flute-articulation/)
   - Common problems & solutions: No Articulation | Incorrect Tongue Placement | Stopping the Sound | Resting Position
   - Ask questions: Where does your tongue touch to start the note? | How much of your tongue is making contact to begin each note? |
     Where does your tongue go AFTER it starts the note? | Play a high note then a low note. Is your tongue touching in the same place for both?

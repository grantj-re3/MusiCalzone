   - Five steps; **excellent detail**
   - "A good bow hold feels so natural you hardly notice it and rarely think about it. It balances the elements of both flexibility and strength"
   - "Place your bent right thumb so that half of its tip rests on the lip of the frog and half of it rests on the bow stick (Fig. 3)."

   - [0m28s-1m10s] Thumb: Bow stick rests on the corner of your thumbnail. 
   - When she first places the thumb on the bow, the thumbnail appears to face the bow tip,
     however once all her fingers are on the bow with weight on the index finger it appears the
     thumbnail faces about 30° below the horizontal bow.
   - [1m54s] Exercise 1: Window wiper
   - [3m20s] Exercise 2: The bridge

   - [Bow Grip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_hGdGVruH8) 
     * Very briefly shows the grip and describes the purpose of each finger
     * [0m9s] Shows the **contact point for each finger**
     * Thumb appears to be rotated about 45° below the horizontal bow
   - Bow Grip: Flexibility - exercise
   - Keep the Same Bow Grip! - exercise

   - [2m56s] Exercise 1: Lift the bow from the D string **using the pinky** without making a sound.
     Also use the pinky to lower the bow onto the D string without making a sound.
     * Try mid-bow
     * Try near the bow tip
   - [5m11s] Exercise 2: **Use your fingers** to roll the bow from the E string to the G string... then back.
     * Try with low elbow
     * Try with mid-height elbow (around A & D string); easiest
     * Try with high elbow; feels strange at the E string
     * [6m22s] If pinky falls off the bow, consider purchasing a "pinky grip" (or "pinky hold") bow training aid
   - [6m50s] Exercise 3: With the bow held vertically, move the bow up and down by flexing the fingers
     * Quite challenging
     * Use all 5 fingers but especially the thumb and the back two
     * The motion is as if you are picking up an object
     * The forearm must not move
   - [8m30s] Exercise 4: With the bow held about 30° from the horizontal, use the same finger movement as for exercise 3
     to lower the bow (about 1 inch) onto the violin strings then lift it off again.
     * Do this near the frog.
     * Consider using the pinky grip training aid to help with this
   - [9m51s] Exercise 5: Hold the bow horizontally and slowly remove fingers from the bow hold.
     * Remove index finger first
     * Then middle finger
     * Then ring finger (leaving only thumb and pinky)
     * When you put all the fingers back on you may need to re-adjust your hand position
     * This exercise is easier if your hand position is several inches towards the middle of the bow (with the pinky on the winding)
   - [11m51s] Bonus exercise:
     * Swap the position of the bow tip and frog
     * Hold the bow a little closer to the tip than the frog
     * Play something (like a scale) where you must cross strings
   - Consider:
     * Placing the pinky on the octagonal surface of the bow adjacent to the top (on the near side)
     * Tilting the bow (so the wood is nearer the scroll)

   - Violin bows have been deliberately (re)designed so that they spring/bounce!
   - Apply more weight
     * hold elbow and wrist a little higher
     * apply the weight of the arm via the *lowest* joint of the index finger
   - Tilt the bow (so hairs face towards you)
   - Keep the bow moving; do not slow down (perhaps move bow faster)

     * Bowing is too light
     * Bow direction change is not *connected*
     * [8m55s] *Climbing* drill to exercise right finger muscles and joints

   - Pulling the bow rather than pushing it - with flexible fingers.
     * Like using a paint brush

       + Demo of how to hold the bow;
         Your fingers need to be comfortably together rather than spread;
         The tip of your pinky should be on top of the [frog]
       + Your right elbow should lead the motion
       + Practice while applying more pressure than usual to develop the timing and correct feeling
         [so you can feel the bow sticking to the strings]
       + Practice this exercise with a pencil
       + Exaggerate the movement when working on this technique so that the movement will come by itself after much practice
   - Keeping the instrument a little higher, even if it's only an inch.
   - Turning the bow inwards slightly for more of a shock absorber effect.
   - Loosening the bow.

   1. Practice performing; or practice after running!
   1. Thumb and pinky should be curved in your bow hand
   1. Finger action in your bow hand; as an alternative to *lifting your wrist* as the bow hand approaches
      the violin, consider *bending the pinky more*
   1. Add weight to the bow (via arm and index finger); even works for piano
   1. Tilt the bow; the stick tilts towards the scroll
   1. Relax body, especially right shoulder; keep the right shoulder low
      - Exercise: Lift the right shoulder towards your ear then let it fall
   1. Exercise: Get to know your bow; make the bow jump on purpose; experiment to find where your bow bounces
   1. Practice switching between bowing techniques
   1. Avoid coffee/caffeine, etc. before your performance

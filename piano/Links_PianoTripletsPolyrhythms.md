   The trick is simply to flatten it:

   1           2           1           2           1
   *           *           *           *           *
   *       *       *       *       *       *       *
   1       2       3       1       2       3       1

   |       |   |   |       |
   v       v   v   v       v

   *       *   *   *       *       *   *   *       *


   Another way to see it is that there are 6 beats (mathematically, LCM [Lowest Common Multiple]
   of 2 and 3). Beats 2 and 6 are not played:

   *       *   *   *       *       *   *   *       *
   1  (2)  3   4   5  (6)  1  (2)  3   4   5  (6)  1
   ```

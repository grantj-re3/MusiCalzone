   1. If you are a beginner, learn hands-separate first then learn with hands together
   2. ***Play slowly if you are finding a piece difficult***
   3. Avoid playing pieces/passages which are too difficult for your level
   4. Resources:
      - scales
      - scale exercise:
        * play the scale of C major (starting at C3) as crotchets with the left hand (1 octave, up only)
        * simultaneously, play the scale of C major (starting at C4) as quavers with the right hand (1 octave up and down; do not repeat the C5 note)
        * both should finish on the same note, C4
        * repeat the exercise where the left hand plays quavers at C3 and the right hand plays crotches starting at C4 (hands should finish on C3 and C5)
        * repeat for 4 notes in one hand vs 1 note in the other
        * repeat for different major scales

   1. Chord mastery:
      - Learn all major chords:
        * All-white key major chords: C, F, G
        * Major chords with a sharp in the middle: D, E, A
        * Major chords with a flat on the outside (root and fifth) positions: Db, Eb, Ab
        * B major (white-black-black) and Bb major (black-white-white)
        * All-black key major chord: F#
      - Learn how to alter the major chords to create the other triad chords:
        * Minor: lower the middle note (the third)
        * Diminished: lower the middle note (the third) and the top note (the fifth)
        * Augmented: raise the top note (the fifth)
   1. Note reading: Try doing quizzes at musictheory.net in areas where you are weak
   1. *Sight* reading music:
      - Analyse the piece first
      - Play through twice
      - Practice something which is just below your current playing level
      - Recommends some books and church hymnal
   1. Music theory:
      - Chords, chord progressions (e.g. I-IV-V-I), key signatures, time signatures
      - Book: Alfred's Essentials of Music Theory
   1. Practice with a metronome
   1. Practice memorising a whole piece
      - Why? Allows you to concentrate on the *music*, e.g. phrasing, dynamics, articulation
      - Start by having the music in front of you so you can read portions of it if necessary
      - Break it up into sections
      - Consider memorising right and left hand separately
   1. Practice dexterity
      - Using the right fingers at the right time with the right finger motion
      - Scales
      - Arpeggios
      - Exercises
      - Book: Alfred's Complete Book of Scales, Chords, Arpeggios & Cadences

   1. Slow practice = fast progress
   1. Consistency with your practice: Almost everyday; at least 5-10 minutes
   1. The *counting the beats* trick: Usually, a group of notes with a beam represent 1 beat
   1. The *ledger line rule*: For any clef (e.g. treble clef):
      - the notes *on the lines* of the staff (e.g. E-G-B-D-F) are the same as the notes *between the lines* above the staff
      - the notes *between the lines* of the staff (e.g. F-A-C-E) are the same as the notes *on the lines* above the staff
      - the notes *between the lines* of the staff (e.g. F-A-C-E) are the same as the notes *on the lines* below the staff
   1. Start your practice with the passages you struggle with
   1. Power tip: If you have been practicing for over 30 minutes and you are starting to make mistakes, take a 5 minute break
   1. Sight read every time you practice: Sight reading is the most important skill you can learn while playing the piano;
      practice something which is just below your current playing level
   1. Listen to professional recordings of what you are practicing

1. [The Fastest Method to Learn Piano Pieces (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxnAG8aXe5o)
   - The Deep Sections Method
     * Create small sections (e.g. 1, 2 or 4 bars)
     * Practice the section 7 times "successfully"
     * Rhythm does not matter (i.e. slowing down for difficult portions is ok)
     * Do not use the pedal
     * [Speed not important initially]
     * [Some suggest practicing the last section of a piece first then work your way backwards to the beginning section]
     * Proceed to the next section
     * Try to regard this learning as fun; think of it as a game

My tip: When sight reading, avoid the two-step translation process for note pitch. That is:

- convert the pitch shown on the staff to a note name (e.g. to middle-C), then
- convert the note name to the particular piano key (or fingering on your instrument)

Instead when sight reading, aim to use a one-step translation process for note pitch:

- convert the pitch shown on the staff straight to the particular piano key (or fingering on your instrument)

     - Practice the movement of the jump without playing the landing chord (then you can
       analyse which fingers have not landed in the right place)
     - Aim for efficiency of movement and accuracy
     - Practice and repetition should help

     - Ensure you *spot* the note which you are jumping to
     - Soft focus: Often you will be doing something with both hands while jumping, so you may consider
       ensuring your eyes are not too close to the keyboard and allow your peripheral vision to see both hands
     - Queueing: Left and right hands do not need to land simultaneously; you can move one first (e.g.
       where your eyes are already looking) then the next; the movement of the two hands can still be fast

   + Find the mid-point of the jump; rotate your wrists around that mid-point during the jump;
     practice reaching downwards and upwards from that mid-point
   + Transition very quickly to the landing chord, but pause before playing the notes (to ensure
     you have a clean jump)

   + I have listed Josh's videos below with the most recent first. However, since he
     mentions earlier videos during his later ones, you might consider watching the 
     bottom one first and work your way to the top.

     - do one thing at a time; find the landing note in one hand before you find the landing
       note in next hand; perhaps land on the one which is in front of your face/eye-line first
     - new: look for the easier interval for the jump (e.g. if you are jumping up from one
       chord to another, perhaps look at the highest take-off finger and the lowest landing finger)
       * use an intermediate unplayed note
       * his example is F#-(thumb) to E-(thumb)-and-E-(pinky) almost 1 and 2 octaves above:
         + F# (1) to F# (4) one octave above [F# (4) is not played]
         + F# (4) to E (1) 2 semitones below
         + E (1) and E (5) one octave above played simultaneously
     - if left and right hands are both jumping and far apart, you may need to be *blind*
       to the easier jump and *spot* the difficult jump
     - consider pausing during the jump for more expression; but practice the jump at full speed

     - good but incomplete video if you have not subscribed
     - while leaving one of your fingers (e.g. the thumb) on a key of your last chord,
       search for your landing note by using the 3 black (or 2 black) keys as a guide
       (without playing those unwanted black keys) then feel for the landing note
     - practice feeling various intervals (fifth, fourth, octave, seventh, etc.)

     - free your hands; avoid tension
     - up/down exercise; go back down very quickly after going up
     - new: use a more natural movement to move your hands towards the landing spot
       (like a swatting motion) rather than keeping the hand in a "chord shape"

     - For jumps where you land on a chord, practice:
       * jumping with one hand, taking off with one of the fingers of the take-off-chord
         and landing with one of the fingers of the landing-chord
       * repeat for various take-off and landing fingers before putting the take-off-chord
         and landing-chord together
       * repeat for the other hand (assuming it also jumps) before putting both hands together

     - practice with eyes closed
     - change the rhythm to make the jump harder
     - do one thing at a time; find the landing note in one hand before you find the landing
       note in next hand; perhaps practice find the landing note quicker with the weaker hand
